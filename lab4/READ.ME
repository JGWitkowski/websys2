Lab 4 - jQuery Mobile and CSS Media Queries
----------------------------------------------

This application reads in data from Facebook using FB's Javscript SDK. The layout is partly done using jQuery mobile, and CSS media queries are used to make the app responsive. The application is a demonstration of these technologies and simply pulls in
your data including name, location, work, education, photos, and statuses. It does require the users permission to access this information.
